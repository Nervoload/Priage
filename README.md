# PRIAGE 🚑💨 
An AI powered emergency department patient pipeline.

Priage improves the emergency room experience for hospitals and patients. Through seemless data transfer, open communication, and quality patient monitoring--Priage transforms confusement and concern into certainty and satisfaction. Priage saves lives by tracking patients, and informing staff on potential disease or injury progression before treatment: whether on the way to the hospital or in the waiting room.

Priage enables communication between patients and ER staff, allowing for updates directly from the waiting room. The medical team can view the condition, health status, messages and more for all patients. 

# Development 

We are building a modular platform for Hospitals, Clinics and Patients. We want to build a prototype to present to Hospitals, and so we need to build the basic architecture which will be the foundation for scaling in the future. We are going to build the following:

1) The backend infrastructure to transfer patient profile data across the pipeline, send live notifications, and queue jobs for real-time updates. 
2) The Hospital App, with multiple views: The Pre-triage, Triage, and Waiting Room views for different staff members downstream of the pipeline.
3) The Patient App, which can initiate a notice to a hospital, and then can communicate with the hospital according to the stage of the pipeline the patient is in. 

Below is our proposed tech stack:

```

For our protoype, we want to implement a complete backend that can handle live updates from our Hospital App users and our Patient App users. 

## Server: 

We will deploy a relational database system, which is the endpoint for reads and writes from our apps.

For our database management, we will use **PostgreSQL** (standard for webapps) to deal with our relational database. To host our databases, we can use a cloud service like **AWS**. We could also just use Google Firebase for testing, and then use AWS for real prototyping/MVP. 

Redis will manage read/write jobs from our backend.

## Backend:

Our backend will encapsulate the communication between our apps, the server, and initiate updates via our own REST APIs. We will manage the following:

The Patient Profile

The Hospital App Updates

Real-time notifications, status updates, and pipeline transfer

Prisma will deal with our query packaging for our DB. 

Our backend will be built on Nest.js: Node and typescript

## Frontend:

Our front end will be built using Vite and React --> for interactive webapps, and easy deployment using Vite. 

# Development Setup:

## External Software
- Docker Desktop (required to run local PostgreSQL + Redis)

---

## 1) Pre-flight checks--verify your machine can run the stack:
Make sure you have node and npm installed! Latest version is fine.
You might also have to download nestjs globally.

### macOS (Terminal)
~~~bash
node -v
npm -v
docker --version
docker compose version
~~~

### Windows (PowerShell)
~~~powershell
node -v
npm -v
docker --version
docker compose version
~~~

If `docker compose` fails, open Docker Desktop and confirm it’s running.

---

## 2) Install repo dependencies (Node packages):

From the repo root (the folder that contains `backend/` and `Apps/`):

### macOS (Terminal)
~~~bash
cd /Priage/backend/

# Prefer a clean, reproducible install when a lockfile exists
if [ -f package-lock.json ]; then
  npm ci
else
  npm install
fi
~~~

### Windows
~~~powershell
cd C:\Priage\backend\

# Prefer a clean, reproducible install when a lockfile exists
if (Test-Path package-lock.json) {
  npm ci
} else {
  npm install
}
~~~

---

## 3) Create local environment files (secrets/config)

Copy the committed examples into local-only files, then edit them in Priage/backend.

### Backend env (NestJS)
#### macOS
~~~bash
cp .env.example .env
~~~

#### Windows
~~~powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
~~~

### Frontend env
Only the Hospital App currently has a committed env example.

#### macOS
~~~bash
cp Apps/HospitalApp/.env.example Apps/HospitalApp/.env
~~~

#### Windows
~~~powershell
Copy-Item Apps\HospitalApp\.env.example Apps\HospitalApp\.env
~~~

`Apps/PatientApp/` exists as source code, but it does not currently have a local dev package setup or committed env example.

---

## 4) Start local infrastructure :PostgreSQL + Redis via Docker Compose

Run from the folder that contains `docker-compose.yml` (The root, /Priage)

### macOS & Windows:
~~~bash/powershell
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
~~~

To watch logs:
- `docker compose logs -f`

To stop everything:
- `docker compose down`

To wipe DB data volumes (destructive):
- `docker compose down -v`

---

## 5) Generate Prisma client + apply migrations)

Run from `backend/'

### macOS & Windows
~~~bash/powershell
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
~~~

If this fails, check:
- Docker DB is up (`docker compose ps`) (or in docker desktop)
- `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` is correct & that backend/.env exists
- Misplaced files (.env, main.ts, tsconfig.json, prisma.config.ts)
---

# Running the Software
For testing locally, the currently runnable stack is:
1) the backend
2) the Hospital App

`Apps/PatientApp/` is present in the repo, but it does not currently have a runnable local dev setup like `Apps/HospitalApp/`.

### Terminal 1 — Backend (NestJS)
#### macOS & Windows
~~~bash/powershell
cd backend
npm run start:dev
~~~

### Terminal 2 — Hospital web app (React + Vite + TypeScript)
#### macOS
~~~bash
cd Apps/HospitalApp
npm run dev
~~~

#### Windows 
~~~powershell
cd Apps\HospitalApp
npm run dev
~~~

(Each dev server prints the local URL in the terminal output btw)
